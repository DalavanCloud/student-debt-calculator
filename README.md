# Student Debt Calculator

> A JavaScript package which calculates student debt at graduation based on a wide array of possible inputs.

This calculator does not simply calculate debt based on loans - given inputs of costs, grants, scholarships, personal savings, and loans, it can calculate how much of the annual cost of attendance is left to pay, total debt at graduation, and monthly payment at graduation, based on combined loans and given loan rates.

__Currently in Beta__

## Dependencies
The package runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It can be included in front-end projects as an npm package - see 'Installation' below.

## Installation
1. Install node.js
2. Run `npm install student-debt-calc --save`

## Usage
`var studentDebtResult = studentDebtCalculator( financials )`

While the command is simple, the key is the `financials` parameter, which is an Object. Here is a sample `financials` Object:

```
var financials = {
    tuitionFees: 10000,
    roomBoard: 2000,
    books: 1000,
    transportation: 500,
    otherExpenses: 250,
    scholarships: 0,
    pell: 0,
    savings: 0,
    family: 0,
    perkins: 0,
    staffSubsidized: 0,
    staffUnsubsidized: 0,
    institutionalLoan: 0,
    privateLoan: 13750,
    undergrad: true
}
```
The script returns an Object (we'll call it `studentDebtResult`, as in the example above), formatted in the same manner as the input, but with calculations made (and new/updated Object properties.

### The financials object

The object passed to `studentDebtCalculator` is used to set up the calculations. Each property has a default value, so properties whose value does not need to be changed from the default can be omitted. Below, we list all the properties used in the calculations. They are separated by category for ease of reading.

#### Costs of Attendance
These values are all added together to get the cost of attendance. They are taken as separate values to match with the [Financial Aid Shopping Sheet](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/guid/aid-offer/index.html).

|`financials.otherExpenses` | number | The cost of miscellaneous expenses. | 0 |
|`financials.transportation` | number | The costs of transporation. | 0 |

#### Grants and Scholarships
These values are deducted from cost of attendance.
